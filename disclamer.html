      <em>'Bitcoin Era App'</em> (<em>'Bitcoin Era App'</em>) allows its users
      (hereinafter: "<strong>User</strong>" or "<strong>Users</strong>") to
      trade in highly speculative investments which involve a significant risk
      of loss. Such trading is not suitable for all investors so Users must
      ensure that Users fully understand the risks before trading.
      <em>'Bitcoin Era App'</em> does not manage, or offer any legal, tax,
      accounting or investment advice, or recommendation regarding suitability,

      document cannot and does not disclose or explain all of the risks and
      other significant aspects involved in dealing in Forex, CFDs and

      Trading in Forex, CFDs and Cryptocurrencies is VERY SPECULATIVE AND HIGHLY
      RISKY and is not suitable for all members of the general public, but only
      for those investors who: (a) Understand and are willing to assume the
      economic, legal and other risks involved. (b) Take into account their
      personal financial circumstances, financial resources, life style and
      obligations are financially able to assume the loss of their entire
      investment. (c) Have the knowledge to understand Forex, CFDs and
      Cryptocurrencies trading and the underlying assets and markets. 'Bitcoin
      Era App' will not provide Users with any advice relating to Forex, CFDs
      and Cryptocurrencies, the underlying assets and markets or make investment
      recommendations of any kind. So, if User does not understand the risks
      involved, he should seek advice and consultation from an independent
      financial advisor. If User still does not understand the risks involved in
      trading in Forex, CFDs and Cryptocurrencies then he should not trade at
      all. Forex, CFDs and Cryptocurrencies are derivative financial instruments
      deriving their value from the prices of the underlying assets/markets to
      which they refer (for example: currencies, equity indices, stocks, metals,
      indices futures, forwards, etc.). It is important, therefore, that User
      understands the risks associated with trading in the relevant underlying
      asset/market because fluctuations in the price of the underlying
      asset/market will affect the profitability of his trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Some such risks include</u>
      Volatility - movements in the price of underlying assets/markets can be
      volatile and unpredictable. This will have a direct impact on User's
      profits and losses. Understanding the volatility of an underlying market
      will help guide User regarding how to trade and how much he is willing to
      lose. Market swings - a swing is a sudden shift in the price of an
      underlying asset price from one level to another. Various factors can lead
      to gapping (for example, economic events or market announcements) and
      gapping can occur both when the underlying market is open and when it is
      closed. When these factors occur while the underlying market is closed,
      the price of the underlying market when it reopens (and therefore our
      derived price) can be markedly different from the closing price, with no
      opportunity to close your trade in-between. 'Gapping' can result in a
      significant loss (or profit). Market liquidity - The prices of Forex, CFDs
      and Cryptocurrencies will be influenced by, amongst other things, changing
      supply and demand relationships, governmental, agricultural, commercial
      and trade programs and policies, national and international political and
      economic events and the prevailing psychological characteristics of the
      relevant market place and some of the Forex, CFDs and Cryptocurrencies'
      underlying assets may not become immediately liquid as a result of reduced
      demand for the underlying asset. So, market conditions can change
      significantly in a very short period of time and hence, under certain
      market conditions, it may be impossible for User's order to be executed,
      leading to losses. It is understood that when it comes to trading in
      currencies, there may be situations, movements and/or conditions occurring
      at weekend, in the beginning of week or intra-day after release of
      significant macroeconomic figures, economic or political news that make
      currency markets to open with price levels that may substantially differ
      from previous prices. *HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WARNING* Trading Forex, CFDs
      and Cryptocurrencies involve a risk of losing your investment. This Risk
      Warning Notice cannot and does not disclose all the risks and other
      significant aspects of option and derivative trading. You should not
      speculate with capital that you cannot afford to lose. We strongly suggest
      you read through our Website's
